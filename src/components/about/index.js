          Hi! My name is Atin, although my family mostly call me Naman which is my pet name. 
          I am a 24 year old programmer and currently work as a software developer for a company called Primus software.
          I did my Bachelors of technology from Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering college, Ghaziabad.
          I was originally born in bareilly, but for the majority of my life I've been living in Noida.
        </p>

          Apart from working on various programming projects, I like to spend my free time playing video games and reading Japnese comics or manga.
          I am also a big football fan and a diehard Real Madrid fan. My favourite player is Cristiano Ronaldo and I've lived through the greatest rivalry in football history i.e Ronaldo vs Messi.
          I also like to click photos of scenic beauty though I am pretty amateur at that. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for programming started a couple of years ago, when I got to work on a friend's personal project built on React.
          I got intruiged by React and started reading articles on it's internal architecture which fascinated me a lot.
          After that I went on and loved trying different technologies.
        </p>

          I hope you enjoy this website as much as I've enjoyed making it, and don't forget to check out my socials! üòÅ
